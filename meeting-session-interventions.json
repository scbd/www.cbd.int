INTRODUCTION 1. Further to the decision by the Bureau of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice to hold a six-day informal meeting of the Subsidiary Body, I would like to share the organization of work for the informal session scheduled to begin on 17 February 2021. 2. The virtual informal meeting in preparation for the twenty-fourth meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice will contribute to maintaining momentum and to advancing the preparations for the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties. It will include interventions on the pre-session documents for items on the agenda of the twenty-fourth meeting of the Subsidiary Body similar to the first reading at formal meetings of the Subsidiary Body. Participants are encouraged to focus their interventions on comments on the draft recommendations set out in pre-session documents. There will be no negotiations at this session; thus, there will be no formal substantive outcomes, decisions or conference room papers from the meeting. However, there is an expectation that, when the formal meeting of the Subsidiary Body is held, to increase efficiency, Parties may refer to their statements at this informal session and only make additions if so needed. The recently adopted budget for the Convention has within it an accommodation for a six-day meeting. 3. Key elements of the meeting include: (a) The meeting will include statements (equivalent to the first reading at a physical meeting) All statements will be recorded, and written submissions will be posted online. Participants may wish to send pre-recorded statements and written submissions to the Secretariat prior to the informal meeting as backup in the case of unforeseeable connection problems during the informal meeting; (b) Together with the Chair of the Subsidiary Body, the Secretariat will prepare a short procedural report on the informal session, noting the Parties and observers making interventions; (c) The list of all registered participants will be available to participants prior to the meeting; (d) All sessions will last three hours per day and will be held from 7 to 10 a.m. Montreal time, with a 15-minute break approximately midway through each session; (e) All requests for the floor by Parties will be heard for each agenda items during the online informal meeting. Statements by stakeholder groups will also be heard, as well as other observers as time allows; (f) There will be a short opening session which will include short statements by the Presidency of the Conference of the Parties, the Chair and the Executive Secretary, but no keynote presentations; (g) Each agenda item will start with regional and group statements after the introduction of the item by the Secretariat. However, there will be no regional or group statements during the opening or closing sessions of the informal meeting; (h) As usual, statements on each agenda item from Parties and observers will follow previous approach and be limited to 5 minutes on behalf of the region/group and 3 minutes for individual interventions; (i) There will be provision for an online platform consultation for regional groups, as requested by regions. Regions are encouraged to hold preparatory meetings in the week prior to the session. Regions will need to advise the Secretariat of the time best suited for them; 2 (j) Regular meetings of the Bureau of the Subsidiary Body are expected to be held in order to assess progress. The Bureau will need to decide the frequency of these meetings; (k) Individual sessions on agenda items will be chaired by the Chair of the Subsidiary Body or a member of the Bureau. II. SUGGESTED ORGANIZATION OF WORK 4. Below is the proposed organization of work, agreed by the Bureau. Every attempt will be made to cover all agenda items during the informal meeting. However, this is dependent on the number of requests for the floor per agenda item.

INTRODUCTION 1. Further to the decision by the Bureau of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice to hold a six-day informal meeting of the Subsidiary Body, I would like to share the organization of work for the informal session scheduled to begin on 17 February 2021. 2. The virtual informal meeting in preparation for the twenty-fourth meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice will contribute to maintaining momentum and to advancing the preparations for the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties. It will include interventions on the pre-session documents for items on the agenda of the twenty-fourth meeting of the Subsidiary Body similar to the first reading at formal meetings of the Subsidiary Body. Participants are encouraged to focus their interventions on comments on the draft recommendations set out in pre-session documents. There will be no negotiations at this session; thus, there will be no formal substantive outcomes, decisions or conference room papers from the meeting. However, there is an expectation that, when the formal meeting of the Subsidiary Body is held, to increase efficiency, Parties may refer to their statements at this informal session and only make additions if so needed. The recently adopted budget for the Convention has within it an accommodation for a six-day meeting. 3. Key elements of the meeting include: (a) The meeting will include statements (equivalent to the first reading at a physical meeting) All statements will be recorded, and written submissions will be posted online. Participants may wish to send pre-recorded statements and written submissions to the Secretariat prior to the informal meeting as backup in the case of unforeseeable connection problems during the informal meeting; (b) Together with the Chair of the Subsidiary Body, the Secretariat will prepare a short procedural report on the informal session, noting the Parties and observers making interventions; (c) The list of all registered participants will be available to participants prior to the meeting; (d) All sessions will last three hours per day and will be held from 7 to 10 a.m. Montreal time, with a 15-minute break approximately midway through each session; (e) All requests for the floor by Parties will be heard for each agenda items during the online informal meeting. Statements by stakeholder groups will also be heard, as well as other observers as time allows; (f) There will be a short opening session which will include short statements by the Presidency of the Conference of the Parties, the Chair and the Executive Secretary, but no keynote presentations; (g) Each agenda item will start with regional and group statements after the introduction of the item by the Secretariat. However, there will be no regional or group statements during the opening or closing sessions of the informal meeting; (h) As usual, statements on each agenda item from Parties and observers will follow previous approach and be limited to 5 minutes on behalf of the region/group and 3 minutes for individual interventions; (i) There will be provision for an online platform consultation for regional groups, as requested by regions. Regions are encouraged to hold preparatory meetings in the week prior to the session. Regions will need to advise the Secretariat of the time best suited for them; 2 (j) Regular meetings of the Bureau of the Subsidiary Body are expected to be held in order to assess progress. The Bureau will need to decide the frequency of these meetings; (k) Individual sessions on agenda items will be chaired by the Chair of the Subsidiary Body or a member of the Bureau. II.

INTRODUCTION 1. Further to the decision by the Bureau of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice to hold a six-day informal meeting of the Subsidiary Body, I would like to share the organization of work for the informal session scheduled to begin on 17 February 2021. 2. The virtual informal meeting in preparation for the twenty-fourth meeting of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice will contribute to maintaining momentum and to advancing the preparations for the fifteenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties. It will include interventions on the pre-session documents for items on the agenda of the twenty-fourth meeting of the Subsidiary Body similar to the first reading at formal meetings of the Subsidiary Body. Participants are encouraged to focus their interventions on comments on the draft recommendations set out in pre-session documents. There will be no negotiations at this session; thus, there will be no formal substantive outcomes, decisions or conference room papers from the meeting. However, there is an expectation that, when the formal meeting of the Subsidiary Body is held, to increase efficiency, Parties may refer to their statements at this informal session and only make additions if so needed. The recently adopted budget for the Convention has within it an accommodation for a six-day meeting. 3. Key elements of the meeting include: (a) The meeting will include statements (equivalent to the first reading at a physical meeting) All statements will be recorded, and written submissions will be posted online. Participants may wish to send pre-recorded statements and written submissions to the Secretariat prior to the informal meeting as backup in the case of unforeseeable connection problems during the informal meeting; (b) Together with the Chair of the Subsidiary Body, the Secretariat will prepare a short procedural report on the informal session, noting the Parties and observers making interventions; (c) The list of all registered participants will be available to participants prior to the meeting; (d) All sessions will last three hours per day and will be held from 7 to 10 a.m. Montreal time, with a 15-minute break approximately midway through each session; (e) All requests for the floor by Parties will be heard for each agenda items during the online informal meeting. Statements by stakeholder groups will also be heard, as well as other observers as time allows; (f) There will be a short opening session which will include short statements by the Presidency of the Conference of the Parties, the Chair and the Executive Secretary, but no keynote presentations; (g) Each agenda item will start with regional and group statements after the introduction of the item by the Secretariat. However, there will be no regional or group statements during the opening or closing sessions of the informal meeting; (h) As usual, statements on each agenda item from Parties and observers will follow previous approach and be limited to 5 minutes on behalf of the region/group and 3 minutes for individual interventions; (i) There will be provision for an online platform consultation for regional groups, as requested by regions. Regions are encouraged to hold preparatory meetings in the week prior to the session. Regions will need to advise the Secretariat of the time best suited for them; 2 (j) Regular meetings of the Bureau of the Subsidiary Body are expected to be held in order to assess progress. The Bureau will need to decide the frequency of these meetings; (k) Individual sessions on agenda items will be chaired by the Chair of the Subsidiary Body or a member of the Bureau. II. SUGGESTED ORGANIZATION OF WORK 4. Below is the proposed organization of work, agreed by the Bureau. Every attempt will be made to cover all agenda items during the informal meeting.

We also want to greet all participants. We are beyond happy and thankful to God for taking care of us during this challenging COVID-19 periods. Mr. Chair, As you know that the time, we are in, is very critical and we have a lot of things to do to reverse the existing dangerous human behavior in each and every corner of the world in relation to biodiversity and the environment. As it is already said, that human activity is causing the sixth mass-extinction-the in the history of the planet, which is taken as hypothetic fun for those who do not have care for nature, biodiversity or the environment, which they are living in. We look forward to the actual meeting of SBSTTA 24 and other related meetings of COP/MOP to agree on those very crucial issues (such as the Post-2020 global biodiversity framework, marine and coastal biodiversity, biodiversity and agriculture, biodiversity and climate change, biodiversity and health) and work together with the same spirit for the coexistence of all living thing in the harmony with nature. Ethiopia is a landlocked country but it has a concern about marine ecosystems since 50-80% of the oxygen production on Earth comes from these ecosystems, mainly from the oceanic plankton-drifting plants, algae, and some bacteria that can photosynthesize. The loss of oxygen and the warming of oceans cause biological annihilation of marine ecosystems and simultaneously the extinction of all oxygen-dependent life forms on earth including human beings! The global effort towards its ambition \"Living in harmony with nature\" can be achieved by integrating the knowledge of IPLC with, which can take us a long way towards sustainable human development. Mr. Chair, In order to become more successful in our future COP 15 decision, today we have to be open to influence ready to contribute, a good listener to others' views and find out the reasons for their positions not in agreement solely for the sake of agreement ready to appreciate differences Finally, we have to say: Yes! we support the decision and we decided to Living and Working in Harmony with Nature! Thank you, Mr. Chair!

Chair Ethiopia is pleased to deliver the statement on behalf of the Africa Group and wishes to reiterate that, it is our understanding that this informal virtual meeting is not a negotiation and that Parties reserve the right to make amendments or introduce new issues as appropriate when formal negotiations resume. Africa would like to commend the work done thus far through various processes during the current intersessional period, including the studies on living modified fish and living modified organisms containing engineered gene drives and the analysis done on the two topics by the Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group (AHTEG) on Risk Assessment. Africa notes the AHTEG's recognition that resources related to risk assessment of living modified fish do exist, including documents prepared by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Food Safety Authority, and others developed specifically in context of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. In addition, various resources on risk assessment of living modified animals in general are available. Africa agrees with the view that existing resources sufficiently address risk assessment needs and accordingly supports the decision that the development of guidance on risk assessment of living modified fish should not be prioritized at this stage. Africa notes the AHTEG's conclusion that resources related to risk assessment of living modified organisms containing engineered gene drives do exist and that these could be useful resources when undertaking risk assessments, but that these are not always globally applicable. Africa is therefore of the view that existing risk assessment resources should be revised or adapted to align with the locally relevant objective of the Cartagena Protocol. Africa supports scientifically sound, case-by-case risk assessments and a decision-making process that weighs risks against benefits including the perspectives of indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs), as may be appropriate. Africa is concerned about the proposed establishment of an AHTEG on Risk Assessment. Africa is of the view that the establishment of an AHTEG must always be based on a clear and significant mandate, which cannot be accomplished through existing structures or processes. Lastly, Africa is also concerned about the low visibility of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety during this intersessional period and would like to remind Parties of decision CP-9 of COPMOP 9. Herein the Parties stressed the importance of including biosafety in the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as the necessity of developing a specific Implementation Plan for the Cartagena Protocol as a follow-up to the 2011-2020 Strategic Plan for the Protocol. Africa therefore requests the same level of attention for the plan. I thank you.

Our latest National Report (NR6) to the CBD includes a description of the national contribution to the achievement of the objectives of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation. Some needs have been identified to fully meet each national objective in biodiversity conservation and some are specific to plant conservation, which should be implemented within the framework of the next phase of the GSPC, Madagascar has been assisted by an international partnership that is already in place, i.e. the Global Partnership for Plant Conservation,that is able to support Madagascar Party in the implementation of the targets of the post-2020 GBF, through an aligned GSPC. This is a value to us to help meet our CBD obligations. Therefore, the present submission is to express Madagascar's support for a post-2020 GSPC. Madagascar: Welcomes the Plant Conservation Report 2020 and the summary that was included in GBO-5 ;and highlights several plant conservation items of progress in Madagascar, which the GSPC has helped to stimulate, including tree red listing; community based in situ conservation; a national yam species conservation strategy and the conservation of traditional knowledge; Acknowledges the important role that the GSPC has played in mobilizing action in Madagascar, particularly in relation to plant conservation, and also towards the achievement of several Aichi Targets; Recommends that an updated GSPC should be developed and fully aligned with the post 2020 GBF, specifying specific sub-targets or components where appropriate; Madagascar looks forward to the implementation of a Madagascar/MPSG Species Conservation Plan by extending the conservation status knowledge on miscellaneous plants groups and by promoting actions to reverse the species decline, especially on focusing to the use ofnative plant species on ecosystem restoration over the coming years which will align with the targets and objectives of a post-2020 GSPC; Requests the Executive Secretary, in consultation with the SBSTTA co- Chairs, to develop proposals accordingly, aligning a proposed post- 2020 GSPC with the first draft of the post 2020 GBF for consideration by COP.

Synthetic Biology Statement Belarus on behalf of the CEE region Dear Chair, Ladies and Gentlemen, Allow me to address the statement on behalf of the Central and Eastern European Region. We would like to thank Secretariat for preparing Document CBD/SBSTTA/24/4/REV1. We would like to expresses our deep appreciation to the Secretariat of the Convention for organizing, ensuring and supporting the effective work of the Open-ended Online Forum on Synthetic Biology and the Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group (AHTEG) on Synthetic Biology. The CEE Region welcomes the suggested recommendations of the Document on synthetic biology and support them to be adopted by SBSTTA and submitted to the Conference of the Parties at its fifteenth meeting. The CEE Region would like to support the need for further work of the AHTEG group on synthetic biology. There is increased emergence of technologies that are expanding the scale and depth of ecosystem-wide engineering, and thus increasing risks to biodiversity and human health. Therefore, we welcome the process for broad and regular horizon scanning, monitoring and assessment of the most recent technological developments in synthetic biology, so as to be able to adequately review new information regarding their impacts. We stress the need for the Multidisciplinary Technical Expert Group on Synthetic Biology to support this process, to incorporate the expertise needed to cover the increasing diversity of developments that are rapidly expanding in different fields, and fully take into account human and animal health, cultural and socioeconomic impacts, etc. The horizon scanning, monitoring and assessment process should be informed by the trends in new technological developments identified by the AHTEG on Synthetic Biology. The Multidisciplinary Technical Expert Group should review and assess these new technological developments in synthetic biology as well as synthetic biology applications that are in early stages of research and development, vis-à-vis the three objectives of the Convention. We would like to note that research and development on organisms containing engineered gene drives is progressing, and reiterate that the organisms that are developed by gene drive technology and intended for release into the environment or which may be a subject of unintentional release have the potential to result in an irreversible impact on biodiversity. A precautionary approach to such organisms has to be applied. We would note that the detection, identification and monitoring of organisms, components and products of synthetic biology, are important issues, including in a situation of unintentional release into the environment. We urge further work in this respect, including through the Network of Laboratories for the Detection and Identification of LMOs, in particular, to identify potential organisms of synthetic biology for which current detection tools are not sufficient and to develop additional detection, identification and monitoring tools. We would also like to emphasize the need to continue cooperation with other organizations, conventions and initiatives, including academic and research institutions, on issues related to synthetic biology. The CEE Region also reiterates a critical need for capacity building in the field of synthetic biology, including risk assessment, monitoring, control, detection and identification of such organisms.

SBSTTA.docx","text":"Уважаемый председатель, дамы и господа! Снижение темпов утраты биоразнообразия в мире является серьезной проблемой, стоящей перед человечеством в свете того, что если последствия дальнейшей потери биологического разнообразия не будут устранены, они станут необратимыми.. Мы высоко оцениваем предварительную работу по подготовке Глобальной рамочной программы в области биоразнообразия на период после 2020 г., проведенную в беспрецедентных условиях пандемии. Учитывая ограниченность времени, Российская Федерация затронет лишь важнейшие, с нашей точки зрения, позиции документа. Прежде всего, хотелось бы заявить, при расчете и дальнейшем мониторинге выполнения новых целевых показателей их уровень должен быть научно обоснованным и реалистичным. Также индикаторы должны соответствовать мандату Конвенции и содействовать достижению утвержденным Целям устойчивого развития ООН, сохраняя баланс трех измерений ― экономическое, экологическое и социальное, в том числе для борьбы с нищетой.. В формулировке цели А следует ясно указать на необходимость увеличения площадей, имеющих официальный статус особо охраняемых природных территорий международного, национального, регионального и местного значения, так как именно такие территории наиболее эффективно обеспечивают сохранение биологического разнообразия. Имеющееся сейчас достаточно общее указание на «увеличение площадей, связности и целостности природных экосистем» не вполне конкретно и может иметь различные толкования. Не стоит забывать, что помимо увеличения их площадей необходимо развивать и их качество – шире внедряя прогрессивную форму сохранения биоразнообразия – биосферные резерваты. В отношении индикатора «10.0.2 Экосистемы, обеспечивающие сокращение береговой эрозии, защиту от наводнений и другие услуги» предлагаем делить показатели либо потипам экосистем, либо по опасностям и экстремальным явлениям, а не «по полу». Индикатор «10.0.1 Население, проживающее в районах с чистым воздухом и чистой и доступной водой» может быть разбит «по полу». Предлагаем добавить также индикатор «10.0.3 Население, проживающее в районах, защищенных от стихийных бедствий с помощью экосистемных услуг». Мы также бы хотели отметить недостаточное внимание, которое уделено в программе содействию, поддержке и развитию научных исследований в области биологического разнообразия. В Глобальной рамочной программе (задача 19) сделан акцент на доступность информации; по-видимому, предполагается, что всё или почти всё о биологическом разнообразии планеты уже известно. К сожалению, это не так, многие виды до сих пор не описаны или о них имеется очень мало данных; недостаточно обобщенных данных и о разнообразии экосистем. В формулировке упомянутой задачи справедливо отмечается необходимость учета традиционных знаний, но они, при всей их важности, не заменяют и не могут заменить современную научную информацию. Хорошо известно, что важнейшим источником первичных данных о биологическом разнообразии являются научные коллекции, на поддержание и развитие которых необходимо прямо указать в программе и, возможно, ввести соответствующий индикатор. В индикаторы по решению задачи 19 необходимо включить число достоверных научных руководств (в том числе представленных в сети) о биологическом разнообразии отдельных групп организмов в глобальном масштабе, а также для крупных регионов. Также мы предлагаем в формулировке задачи 13 учесть не только необходимость «интегрирования ценностей биоразнообразия» в меры политики, нормативные акты и так далее, но и подчеркнуть, что такой процесс следует осуществлять на основе достоверной, научно обоснованнойинформации путем соответствующих экспертиз в отношении разработки таких мер, нормативных актов, планирования и так далее, в том числе, с учетом региональной специфики. По-видимому, для этой цели следует также разработать соответствующий дополнительный индикатор. В заключение необходимо отметить, что Российская Федерация обладает значительным научным потенциалом в области изучения биологического разнообразия, а также уникальным опытом его сохранения, в том числе на территориях, пока еще незначительно затронутым влиянием деятельности человека. Мы готовы активно делиться и тем и другим в интересах имплементации целей Глобальной программы. Спасибо за внимание! ","date":{"$date":"2021-02-16T13:54:33Z"},"filename":"___________ (3) ____.

Risk Assessment and Risk Management Statement Belarus on behalf of the CEE region Dear Chair, Ladies and Gentlemen, Allow me to address the statement on behalf of the Central and Eastern European Region. We would like to thank Secretariat for preparing Document CBD/SBSTTA/24/5. We would like to expresses our deep appreciation to the Secretariat of the Convention for organizing, ensuring and supporting the effective work of the Open-ended Online Forum on Risk Assessment and the Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group on Risk Assessment in the new circumstances. The CEE Region welcomes the suggested recommendations of the Document on Risk assessment and risk management and support them to be adopted by SBSTTA and submitted to the Conference of the Parties at its fifteenth meeting. The Region considers further development of additional guidance materials on risk assessment for living modified organisms containing engineered gene drives as important. The CEE Region supports the outcomes of the discussions of the Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group on Risk Assessment and endorses the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group that guidance for the risk assessment on living modified organisms containing engineered gene drives should be developed, and it considers important to establish an AHTEG group on risk assessment of LMOs to develop additional guidance materials. It should be noted that such organisms have the potential to result in an irreversible impact on biodiversity, and that this is amplified by the inability to control a gene drive after release, and the lack of management plans to reverse or recall them. To be mentioned there are numerous challenges to risk assessment due to, inter alia, the increased uncertainties regarding next generation effects in wild populations, evolutionary consequences and the potential for unintended effects to occur over time in genetically diverse wild populations. We think that the development of the guidance on risk assessment on LMOs containing engineered gene drives should build on and complement already existing CBD decisions on gene drives, including applying a precautionary approach. The terms of reference for the AHTEG developing guidance on risk assessment for LMOs containing engineered gene drives should therefore reflect this. This would contribute to a coordinated approach under the CBD and Cartagena Protocol on synthetic biology. We would like to stress the importance of continued work to identify additional issues on which guidance materials on risk assessment may be needed, taking into account priorities identified by Parties, including through their national reports. We would also like to emphasize the need to continue cooperation with other organizations, conventions and initiatives, including academic and research institutions, on issues related to risk assessment and risk management of LMOs. The CEE Region also reiterates a critical need for capacity building in the field of risk assessment and risk management of LMOs in accordance with the guidelines developed under the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.

February 2021 Statement of Portugal on the Agenda Item 3 - Post-2020 global biodiversity framework: scientific and technical information to support the review of the updated goals and targets, and related indicators and baselines Thank you, Madam Chair. (Distinguished SBSTTA Chair Distinguished Executive Secretary Distinguished Co-Chairs) Distinguished Delegates Portugal wishes to thank the Secretariat and the SBSTTA-Chair for organizing this virtual meeting, and for the preparation of this agenda item and all related documents. Although this is an informal meeting, we believe it has a very important role in developing the work for the formal sessions and in keeping the momentum towards COP15. Portugal supports a strong monitoring framework as a fundamental tool for a robust monitoring, reporting, stocktake and review mechanism that will contribute to an effective implementation of the action targets and also to an efficient communication of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Therefore, we think that the monitoring framework constitutes an integral part of the Post-2020 GBF and it should be adopted at the same time at COP15. We support the proposed structure of the monitoring framework, which aims to ensure a common basis for monitoring and reporting on the Post-2020 GBF through the headline indicators, while providing a wider set of component and complementary indicators that allow for different levels and scopes in monitoring and reporting on the progress made towards goals and targets, by Parties and other stakeholders. Portugal considers the proposal of 48 Headline Indicators as a useful starting point. However, we believe that a shorter list would enable aggregation of national data in a global stocktake and ensure accountability, as well as facilitate political commitment and communication. Also, some of them are not fully developed or operational. Thus, Portugal is committed to promote thorough and profound discussions on the monitoring framework and also on the scientific and technical aspects of the goals and targets of the Post-2020 GBF. Portugal considers that indicators in the monitoring framework should be aligned, as much as possible, with those already in use or under development by other relevant multilateral environmental agreements, in order to minimize the reporting burden and reinforce synergies. Portugal supports the need to keep the monitoring framework under review to allow for better and/or new indicators to be incorporated on the basis of scientific and technical advice, and hence supports the establishment of a Technical Expert Group. However, we believe that the proposed Terms of Reference need adjustments, namely regarding its mandate and the relation with existing organizations. Finally, Portugal believes that very high levels of ambition will be needed if we want to achieve the 2050 vision and goals defined in the Post-2020 GBF. This will involve a precise wording of the goals and targets, as well as setting the necessary level of science-based numerical elements. In addition, a higher level of political commitment and means of implementation need to be secured. Thank you, Madam Chair.","date":{"$date":"2021-02-16T14:32:41Z"},"filename":"PT statement - 3 Post 2020 GBF.pdf","contentType":"application/pdf","language":"en","allowPublic":true}],"meta":{"createdOn":{"$date":"2021-02-16T14:32:42.206Z"},"createdBy":{"userId":"5f5654ceca39660e50588b5f","name":"Eduardo Carqueijeiro"},"updatedOn":{"$date":"2021-02-16T14:32:46.12Z"},"updatedBy":{"userId":"5f5654ceca39660e50588b5f","name":"Eduardo Carqueijeiro"}},"title":"Portugal","summary":"","status":"pending","datetime":{"$date":"2021-02-16T14:32:42.206Z"},"meetingId":{"$oid":"52000000cbd0495c000017ad"},"meeting":{"_id":{"$oid":"52000000cbd0495c000017ad"},"symbol":"SBSTTA-24-PREP-03"},"conferenceId":{"$oid":"5ff86ba2a819d61010a9c02b"},"conference":{"_id":{"$oid":"5ff86ba2a819d61010a9c02b"},"symbol":"sbstta24-sbi3-is-code-to-be-determined"},"agendaItem":3,"agenda":{"prefix":null,"item":3},"government":"pt","governmentName":"Portugal","organizationId":{"$oid":"536a9b6386d9670f14aa8469"},"organization":{"_id":{"$oid":"536a9b6386d9670f14aa8469"},"name":"Ministry for Environment and Climate Action","acronym":""},"organizationTypeId":{"$oid":"52000000cbd05ebe00000003"},"organizationType":null,"tokens":["","port","portu","portug","portuga"]}

Our thoughts are with all those who have suffered from the COVID pandemic and especially those who have lost their love ones. As we have lost more biodiversity over the past ten years than ever before, the level of ambition for the Goals and Targets of the Post-2020 Framework, must be raised beyond the Aichi Targets. For instance, the Goals and Targets on climate change, restoration, area-based conservation, marine- and coastal biodiversity, and indigenous peoples and local communities need to be stronger in the GBF. The indicators should monitor the 3 objectives of the convention, and the 5 direct drivers as well as the main indirect drivers of biodiversity loss. Finland supports a strong monitoring framework that includes compulsory headline indicators and a review mechanism as part of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The proposed headline indicators still need technical and scientific work and clear baselines. We urge that the Biodiversity Indicator Partnership, IPBES and other relevant science-based organisation be included in the process that will ensure that all headline indicators and their interpretations are scientifically robust. The headline indicators should be included in an Annex to the COP decision on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and the monitoring framework and indicators should be in line with SDGs. Finland is of the opinion, that there is still challenges that hampers a thorough analysis of the suggested Post-2020 indicators. Additional Goals or Targets on climate change and on mainstreaming were proposed at OEWG-2 in Rome but were not included in the updated version of the Zero Draft. Hence, these Goals or Targets, their components and related indicators are not covered by the SBSTTA-24 documents. Indicators related to climate change (e.g. nature-based solutions) and mainstreaming need attention because these Goals or Targets are necessary for a successful outcome of the GBF. On the other hand, some Targets are still formulated in a way that they can't be monitored in a precise way. This holds true especially to the Targets relating to ecosystem-services /nature's benefits to people. The Targets need to be better focused before feasible headline indicators can be assigned to them. In particular, Finland would like point out the following; The 48 headline Indicators contained in Annex 1 of CBD/SBSTTA/24/3 are a useful starting point. Adjustments are still needed, as not all the headline indicators are appropriate, realistic nor implementable. For instance, Target 14 on production practices and supply chain is very important, but at this point the first related headline indicator on potential nature loss from human modification of habitats seems poorly related to the Target and quite impossible to monitor. Finland suggest that the headline indicator should focus on circular economy instead. Related to area-based conservation Targets 1 and 2, the indicators should also focus on restoration and management effectiveness, than just the coverage of land-sea use plans and designated areas. The OECMs need to covered in the indicators as well. Related to Target 9 on sustainability of managed ecosystems, the sustainability of forestry (sustainable forest management, SFM), aquaculture need to be covered by the indicators, alongside with agriculture. Related to Target 19 biodiversity information, we suggest that the establishment and coverage of functional biodiversity monitoring networks at all relevant levels, be included as an indicator. Indicators used under other relevant MEAs and the SDGs have be used fully and technical evaluation, reporting and assessments continued to be made, where feasible. The need to set up a common reference period against which progress towards each of the Goals and Targets of the post-2020 GBF will need to be established as soon as possible. The post-2020 global biodiversity framework still needs improvements to also secure genetic diversity of wild species and also indicators related to IPLCs are insufficient for the coming decade. Genetic diversity post 2020 requires increased ambition and specificity in Goals, Milestones, Targets and indicators. We align ourselves with the intervention made by Portugal, and others, and our changes to the recommendation will be given to the Secretariat. Thank you.

As we have lost more biodiversity over the past ten years than ever before, the level of ambition for the Goals and Targets of the Post-2020 Framework, must be raised beyond the Aichi Targets. For instance, the Goals and Targets on climate change, restoration, area-based conservation, marine- and coastal biodiversity, and indigenous peoples and local communities need to be stronger in the GBF. The indicators should monitor the three objectives of the convention, and the five direct drivers as well as the main indirect drivers of biodiversity loss. Finland supports a strong monitoring framework that includes compulsory headline indicators and a review mechanism as part of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. The proposed headline indicators still need technical and scientific work and clear baselines. We urge that the Biodiversity Indicator Partnership, IPBES and other relevant science-based organisation be included in the process that will ensure that all headline indicators and their interpretations are scientifically robust. The headline indicators should be included in an Annex to the COP decision on the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework and the monitoring framework and indicators should be in line with SDGs. Finland is of the opinion, that there is still challenges that hampers a thorough analysis of the suggested Post-2020 indicators. Additional Goals or Targets on climate change and on mainstreaming were proposed at OEWG-2 in Rome but were not included in the updated version of the Zero Draft. Hence, these Goals or Targets, their components and related indicators are not covered by the SBSTTA-24 documents. Indicators related to climate change (e.g. nature-based solutions) and mainstreaming need attention because these Goals or Targets are necessary for a successful outcome of the GBF. On the other hand, some Targets are still formulated in a way that they can not be monitored in a precise way. This holds true especially to the Targets relating to ecosystem-services /nature's benefits to people. The Targets need to be better focused before feasible headline indicators can be assigned to them. In particular, Finland would like point out the following; The 48 headline Indicators contained in Annex 1 of CBD/SBSTTA/24/3 are a useful starting point. Adjustments are still needed, as not all the headline indicators are appropriate, realistic nor implementable. For instance, Target 14 on production practices and supply chain is very important, but at this point the first related headline indicator on potential nature loss from human modification of habitats seems poorly related to the Target and quite impossible to monitor. Finland suggest that the headline indicator should focus on circular economy instead. Related to area-based conservation Targets 1 and 2, the indicators should also focus on restoration and management effectiveness, than just the coverage of land-sea use plans and designated areas. The OECMs need to covered in the indicators as well. Related to Target 9 on sustainability of managed ecosystems, the sustainability of forestry (sustainable forest management, SFM), aquaculture need to be covered by the indicators, alongside with agriculture. Related to Target 19 biodiversity information, we suggest that the establishment and coverage of functional biodiversity monitoring networks at all relevant levels, be included as an indicator. Indicators used under other relevant MEAs and the SDGs have be used fully and technical evaluation, reporting and assessments continued to be made, where feasible. The need to set up a common reference period against which progress towards each of the Goals and Targets of the post-2020 GBF will need to be established as soon as possible. The post-2020 global biodiversity framework still needs improvements to also secure genetic diversity of wild species and also indicators related to IPLCs are insufficient for the coming decade. Genetic diversity post 2020 requires increased ambition and specificity in Goals, Milestones, Targets and indicators. We align ourselves with the intervention made by Portugal, and others, and our changes to the recommendation will be given to the Secretariat. Thank you.

We believe the suggested GBF as described in the SBSTTA documents falls short of fully embracing these findings. Sweden welcomes SBSTTA INF. document 9i , which offers a scientific evaluation of the level of ambition needed to achieve the CBD 2050 Vision, in terms of extent and integrity of natural ecosystems, extinction risk and abundance of species, and of genetic variation. The conclusion is that only a very high level of ambition would be sufficient. Sweden believes that a science-based glossary for the GBF would be an important communication tool, and help to facilitate the further development of the GBF. Therefore SBSTTA INF. document 11ii on the terms and concepts used in the GBF should be subject to an expert review, and then be used as a basis for further negotiations. Sweden welcomes the proposal for Headline Indicators, that all parties should use to report their progress towards the goals and targets of the GBF. We also support that the Headline Indicators should be supplemented by globally agreed and standardized indicators for each goal and target component, to be used by parties, if applicable, allowing comparability of the progress made on national level towards the specific goal and target components. Sweden considers the proposed 48 Headline Indicators a starting point for further discussion, but adjustments or replacement of indicators are needed, as not all of them are appropriate or sufficient to cover the scope of the goals and targets and their components. We find that the proposed indicator framework has several gaps, for example regarding genetic biodiversity and ecosystem restoration, and several indicators need to be improved or further developed. Finally, Sweden is of the opinion that indicators that reflect overarching issues such as human rights, gender-responsiveness, intergenerational equity, customary sustainable use and the recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, in line with Article 8 (j)iii and 10 (c), and the full and effective participation of IPLCs, women, girls and youth, are not sufficiently reflected in the monitoring framework. Relevant stakeholder and rights holders should be engaged in the further development of indicators. Thank you Chair! i CBD/SBSTTA/24/INF/9.

Sweden would like to thank the Secretariat, the Online Forum and the AHTEG on Risk Assessment for their excellent work in developing the recommendations in the SBSTTA document (CBD/SBSTTA/24/10). We consider it of crucial importance to develop guidance for robust and scientifically sound risk assessments of engineered gene drives and their potential effects on biodiversity, if we are to be able to use this technology for the benefit of human health and biodiversity. There is a great and immediate need for solid guidance, especially for the use of engineered gene drives for the control of mosquito borne diseases and eradication of IAS. This area of use is far advanced and release into the environment may be considered in the near future. Sweden supports the establishment of an ad hoc technical working group to develop additional guidance materials for risk assessment of living modified organisms containing engineered gene drives. We also support the proposal to focus the guidance primarily on Living modified mosquitoes that contain engineered gene drives, but we are open to include other insects containing engineered gene drives. We consider it important for the transparency and acceptance of the work that the AHTEG is responsible for the entire development process of the guidance materials, with a sub-group of experts drawn from the AHTEG developing the detailed outline and first draft. It is also crucial for openness and to ensure the participation of all interested parties in the process, that the Online Forum on Risk Assessment reviews the first draft before the guidance is finalized by the AHTEG and sent to SBSTTA. However, we remain open to hear other parties' views and suggestions regarding the development process.

Building on the proposed pathways for modification of existing EBSAs and bringing forward new EBSAs, Sweden sees the need for amending the Annexes of the draft recommendations to clarify the modification procedure and identification process of EBSAs. Sweden highlights the importance to continue the work of addressing pressures and threats to marine biodiversity, including anthropogenic underwater noise and marine debris, and to include impacts of emerging threats such as deep-sea mining in the future work of the convention. Sweden stresses the importance of increasing the collaboration between CBD, regional sea conventions and competent international organisations, such as ISA, IMO and regional fisheries management organisations. Sweden considers it important to intensify the collaboration with FAO and other fisheries management organisations in order to increase mainstreaming of biodiversity in fisheries and to develop voluntary guidelines for identifying and applying OECMs in fisheries. We support the continuation of capacity-building and partnership activities, and the Global Dialogue within the Sustainable Ocean Initiative to increase knowledge exchange and strengthen international collaboration. Finally, Sweden underscores the need to clarify the links between climate and biodiversity in the ocean, and to include this work strand in CBD's future work. In this context, Sweden suggests to include both conservation of ecosystems that are particularly vulnerable to climate change and ocean acidification, and restoration of coastal and carbon-rich marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves and kelps.

February 2021 Statement of Portugal on the Agenda Item 3 - Post-2020 global biodiversity framework: scientific and technical information to support the review of the updated goals and targets, and related indicators and baselines Thank you, Madam Chair. (Distinguished SBSTTA Chair Distinguished Executive Secretary Distinguished Co-Chairs) Distinguished Delegates Portugal wishes to thank the Secretariat and the SBSTTA-Chair for organizing this virtual meeting, and for the preparation of this agenda item and all related documents. Although this is an informal meeting, we believe it has a very important role in developing the work for the formal sessions and in keeping the momentum towards COP15. Portugal supports a strong monitoring framework as a fundamental tool for a robust monitoring, reporting, stocktake and review mechanism that will contribute to an effective implementation of the action targets and also to an efficient communication of the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Therefore, we think that the monitoring framework constitutes an integral part of the Post-2020 GBF and it should be adopted at the same time at COP15. We support the proposed structure of the monitoring framework, which aims to ensure a common basis for monitoring and reporting on the Post-2020 GBF through the headline indicators, while providing a wider set of component and complementary indicators that allow for different levels and scopes in monitoring and reporting on the progress made towards goals and targets, by Parties and other stakeholders. Portugal considers the proposal of 48 Headline Indicators as a useful starting point. However, we believe that a shorter list would enable aggregation of national data in a global stocktake and ensure accountability, as well as facilitate political commitment and communication. Also, some of them are not fully developed or operational. Thus, Portugal is committed to promote thorough and profound discussions on the monitoring framework and also on the scientific and technical aspects of the goals and targets of the Post-2020 GBF. Portugal considers that indicators in the monitoring framework should be aligned, as much as possible, with those already in use or under development by other relevant multilateral environmental agreements, in order to minimize the reporting burden and reinforce synergies. Portugal supports the need to keep the monitoring framework under review to allow for better and/or new indicators to be incorporated on the basis of scientific and technical advice, and hence supports the establishment of a Technical Expert Group. However, we believe that the proposed Terms of Reference need adjustments, namely regarding its mandate and the relation with existing organizations. Finally, Portugal believes that very high levels of ambition will be needed if we want to achieve the 2050 vision and goals defined in the Post-2020 GBF. This will involve a precise wording of the goals and targets, as well as setting the necessary level of science-based numerical elements. In addition, a higher level of political commitment and means of implementation need to be secured.

February 2021 Statement of Portugal on the Agenda Item 4 - Synthetic Biology Thank you, Mr. Chair. Distinguished Delegates, Portugal wishes to thank the Secretariat for the preparation of all the background documents and reports. Likewise, we wish to recognize and thank the Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group on synthetic biology for its expertise and valuable outputs. In line with the other EU Member States, Portugal supports a process for broad and regular horizon scanning, monitoring and assessment of the most recent technological developments in synthetic biology and considers that the provided working document is a good starting point for discussions under agenda item 4 at SBSTTA-24. Portugal proposes to recall paragraphs 9 to 11 of Decision 14/9 and reinforce the precautionary approach with respect to engineered gene drives. With respect to evaluating synthetic biology against the criteria of new and emerging issues, Portugal does not see the necessity to do further work beyond the Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group and SBSTTA-22 and is not in favour of reopening the discussion. We support an efficient horizon scanning process that should be able to identify the potential positive and negative impacts of synthetic biology and agree on the proposed steps of this process. We are flexible with respect to the implementation of these steps in the horizon scanning process, especially the assessment step, and believe that multidisciplinary expertise is needed for this process and a multidisciplinary Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group can be an adequate option. Portugal is, however, ready to evaluate other options and can be flexible on the exact format and procedures for the assessment as long as the collected information is duly assessed concerning the three objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Therefore, Portugal is open to views and suggestions of other Parties on how the necessary expertise can be guaranteed. Whatever the agreed-upon option, Portugal suggests to clearly describe the role of the actors involved and the procedures of the process to ensure an efficient horizon scanning, monitoring and assessment of the most recent technological developments in synthetic biology regarding the potential impacts and always considering the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Cartagena Protocol and the Nagoya Protocol. Portugal considers that a good way forward is to start with two rounds of horizon scanning during two consecutive intersessional periods where the expert group meets once per intersessional period. Portugal proposes that SBSTTA reviews the process at its 28th meeting and provides a recommendation in this regard to COP-17. Portugal also suggests an interim report on the effectiveness of the process to SBSTTA on its 26th meeting by the Executive Secretary and is open for the adoption of the process at COP 16, if recommended by SBSTTA.

February 2021 Statement of Portugal on the Agenda Item 5 - Risk assessment and risk management of living modified organisms Thank you, Mr. Chair. Distinguished Delegates, Portugal wishes to thank the Secretariat for the preparation of all the background documents and reports. Likewise, we wish to recognize and thank all the members of Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group and Open-ended Online Forum on Risk Assessment and Risk Management for their expertise and valuable contributions. In line with the other EU Member States, Portugal considers of the most importance, to continue the work on risk assessment and risk management of living modified organisms (LMOs) under the Cartagena Protocol and consider the provided working document, including the draft recommendations therein, a good starting point for discussions at SBSTTA 24. Additionally, Portugal believes that the recommendation made by SBSTTA to the COP-MOP should ensure the continuation of the process regarding the identification and prioritization of specific issues of LMOs risk assessment that may warrant future consideration. Capacity-building, cooperation, and knowledge management should also be improved in order to address the needs of Parties on LMOs risk assessment issues. In this context, the Biosafety Clearing House usability and importance should be emphasized. Portugal also welcomes the development of additional guidance materials but would like to stress the need to make sure that all additional guidance materials must be of high technical and scientific quality and useful. In this sense, Portugal agrees on dedicated efforts on the development of additional guidance materials for the risk assessment of LMOs containing engineered gene drives. These should be dedicated to general issues for conducting risk assessment of LMOs containing engineered gene drives and on imminent applications, such as mosquitoes containing engineered gene drives. Portugal agree not to develop guidance materials on living modified fish at this stage and encourage Parties to collaborate and share knowledge and capacity-building and also to make use of existing guidance material. We are also flexible regarding the process for developing additional guidance materials, and open to views and suggestions from other Parties, but would like to make some preliminary suggestions/recommendations in this regard: In particular, we recommend the use of existing guidance materials to avoid work duplication. A close collaboration between all parties and the inclusion of specific expertise and representatives from international organizations during the development of these guidance materials to ensure a successful output. Transparency. The reviewing process should involve all stakeholders, for example in an Open- ended Online Forum and we recommend a clear description of the role of the actors involved and the procedures of the process to ensure an efficient process.

February 2021 Statement of Portugal on the Agenda Item 6 - Marine and Coastal Biodiversity Thank you, Madam Chair. Distinguished Delegates, Portugal wishes to thank the SBSTTA-Chair and the Secretariat for organising this virtual meeting and for the preparation of all background documents and information, namely document CBD/SBSTTA/24/6. Let us first highlight the consolidated conclusions from The IPBES Report of 2019 \"Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\", the IPCC Special Report of 2019 on \"The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate\", and the First United Nations Global Integrated Marine Assessment on \"The Impacts of Climate Change and Related Changes in the Atmosphere on the Oceans\", which all unequivocally express the current scientific consensus about the climate emergency and the species extinction crisis. Their conclusions are alarming and it is with a strong sense of urgency in mind that we are addressing you today in the context of the Marine and Coastal Biodiversity discussions of SBSTTA 24. Being the Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs) a topic within the Marine and Coastal Biodiversity Discussions, Portugal supports splitting the present draft recommendations into two: one on EBSAs, currently part A of the present draft recommendation, and a second on \"Conservation of marine and coastal biodiversity\", currently part B, \"other matters\". Along these lines, and considering the importance of the topics under discussion about conservation of marine biodiversity within the post-2020 GBF, Portugal requests new paragraphs to be introduced in the present draft recommendations, in particular in part B. namely on threats and pressures which are becoming increasingly harmful as well as emerging pressures and threats that should be addressed. These include several types of pollution, such as marine debris, plastic litter and microplastics, which is in line with the resolutions adopted by UNEA parties since 2014 on the issue, as also pesticides, untreated urban sewage hazardous substances in waste water, underwater noise, as well as pressures coming from present and future activities such as deep- sea mining and renewable energy production. Portugal underlines the importance of these issues to be considered in the future work of the Convention. Portugal stresses the need to act for the protection of 30% of the global ocean by 2030 through effective networks of marine protected areas which are fully or strongly protected, guaranteeing the full participation and respect for the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities. Portugal supports the identification of options for updating and improving descriptions of ecologically or biologically significant marine areas and for describing new areas. To do so, we propose amending the paragraphs of the draft Annexes to clarify the modification procedure and identification process of EBSA. Portugal also supports the principle of an expert advisory body/group which should be either the Informal Advisory Group, as outlined in the Annexes III of decisions XIII/12 and 14/9 of the Conference of the Parties but with an extended term and amended Terms of Reference or the relevant expert advisory body, introduced in the Annexes of the present draft recommendations..

February 2021 Statement of Portugal on the Agenda Item 7 – Agriculture and Biodiversity Thank your Mr. Chair. Distinguished delegates, Portugal wishes to thank the Secretariat and the SBSTTA-Chair for organising this virtual meeting which provides a good opportunity to keep our process ongoing, as we consider enhanced communication and cooperation to be important for the development of an effective and successful framework. We also express recognition for the preparation of the document CBD/SBSTTA/24/7/Rev.1, noting its good quality and its different sources and references. We all understand the crucial role of soil biodiversity for life on Earth. Therefore, Portugal appreciates the high quality of FAO Report State of Knowledge for Soil Biodiversity: Status, Challenges and Potentialities, and its valuable contributions to improve the knowledge on soil biodiversity, as well as its conservation and sustainability. Together with the latest, the 2020-2030 draft plan of action for the International Initiative for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Soil Biodiversity is of utmost importance and serves as an excellent input for the post-2020 global biodiversity framework and to our road to Kunming. Acknowledging the critical importance of soil biodiversity and the values delivered by ecosystems to resilient and sustainable food systems that provide healthy and nutritious diets to a growing world population, along with climate stability and ecosystem resilience, Portugal: Welcomes the report and plan of action 2020-2030 for the International Initiative for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Soil Biodiversity, and feels that it should also specifically address soil biodiversity restoration; Recommends that conservation, restoration and sustainable use of soil biodiversity, the development of sustainable agricultural systems and land resource management practices, should be fully integrated into the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, either through a dedicated, specific target or via sub-targets or monitoring elements; Also welcomes the work of the international initiative for the conservation and sustainable use of soil biodiversity, FAO and other related organisations, as well as the work of the UNCCD on land degradation neutrality and is of the view that the work needs to continue in collaboration with the UNEP, IPBES and further relevant organisations. To conclude, emphasizing the interlinkages between soil biodiversity and human health, Portugal encourages SBSTTA to send a strong message to the COP-15, concerning the urgency to step up efforts to address soil biodiversity loss in an integrated and mutually supportive manner at all levels of society and governments, and to implement the necessary actions in support of sustainable development.

February 2021 Statement of Portugal on the Agenda Item 8 - Programme of work of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Mr Chair, Distinguished Delegates, Portugal wishes to thank the SBSTTA-Chair and the Secretariat for organising this virtual meeting and for the preparation of all background documents and information, namely documents CBD/SBSTTA/24/8 and CBD/SBSTTA/24/INF/17. Portugal appreciates the high quality of the IPBES work and its relevant contribution to improving the knowledge base for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, of fundamental importance for the long-term human well-being and sustainable development. The various IPBES deliverables are crucial in raising awareness and promoting the engagement of all sectors of society and provide the best knowledge foundations for more robust evidence- informed policy decisions and action. Portugal also acknowledges the relevance of the ongoing assessments and the IPBES rolling work programme towards 2030. Concerning this, we would like to highlight the methodological assessment regarding the diverse conceptualization of multiple values of nature and its benefits, including biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services; the thematic assessment of the sustainable use of wild species; the thematic assessment of invasive alien species and their control; the thematic assessment of the interlinkages among biodiversity, water, food and health; the work on the interlinkages between biodiversity and climate change; the assessment of the underlying causes of biodiversity loss and the determinants of transformative change; and the methodological assessment of the impact and dependence of business on biodiversity and nature's contributions to people. Furthermore, and in order to support the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity and to enable coherent policies and transformative changes necessary to achieve the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity, the Convention needs to consider all IPBES deliverables in a systematic and regular manner. Portugal supports a second global assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services and an assessment on ecological connectivity, both to be considered by IPBES-9. Portugal considers that the IPBES programme of work towards 2030 can provide relevant inputs to the monitoring, reporting and reviewing of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Therefore, the recommendation needs to be aligned with SBSTTA 24 and SBI 3 recommendations on monitoring and reporting for the post-2020 GBF. To conclude, Portugal would like to highlight the importance of regular national assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem services and of adapting the IPBES outcomes, methodologies and guidance to these national assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem services. The outcomes of such national assessments should also constitute a source of information for the work of IPBES and the implementation, monitoring and reviewing of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.

February 2021 Statement of Portugal on the Agenda Item 10 – Invasive alien species Thank you Madam Chair. Distinguished Delegates, It is widely recognized that invasive alien species are one of the most serious and rapidly growing threats to biodiversity, ecosystem services and food, health and livelihood security. Such species have contributed to the extinction of native plants and animals, the degradation of rare and endangered ecosystems and ecological communities, crop failure and declining agricultural productivity. The threats to biodiversity posed by marine invasive alien species, either from deliberate or accidental introductions (for example, transported in ballast water or as encrusting organisms on vessels), are increasingly serious, still very poorly understood, besides threatening maritime industries, including fisheries, aquaculture and tourism, as well as human health. Other anthropogenic activities that can potentiate invasions include the constantly expanding global trade of living organisms, and e-commerce, which facilitates domestic and international trade, is adding more pressure on the environment by increasing the availability of potentially invasive species. Climate change is also creating more favorable conditions for the spread of invasive alien species, as well as \"awakening\" sleeper alien species. Acknowledging the critical importance of tackling the impacts of invasive alien species, Portugal welcomes the work undertaken by the Inter-agency Liaison Group on Invasive Alien Species and by the World Customs Organization, to address the risks of living organisms as environmentally hazardous goods in transport and cross-border e-commerce, and highlights: the need to take into account the importance of invasive alien species in the work of the Post- 2020 global biodiversity framework, recognizing their role in the loss of biodiversity, and establishing adequate targets and indicators to tackle those impacts; the importance of applying the precautionary approach with regard to the potential use of engineered gene drives for the management of invasive alien species; the need to develop open access portals and other means to inform stakeholders, decision- makers, policymakers and the general public about the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of invasive alien species, and involve them in actions towards preventing, early detecting and controlling invasions; the role of invasive alien species in the transmission of diseases affecting biodiversity, as well as human health. Portugal encourages SBSTTA to send a recommendation to COP-15 about the urgency in adopting a decision concerning the outcomes of the Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group on Invasive Alien Species, especially in what concerns to: The definition of methods for cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis which best apply to the management of invasive alien species; The definition of methods, tools and measures for the identification and mitigation of additional risks associated with cross-border e-commerce in live organisms, as well as strategies for the management of invasive alien species as it relates to the prevention of potential risks arising from climate change and associated naturals disasters and land use changes; The development of risk analysis procedures on the potential consequences of the introduction of invasive alien species on social, including health, economic and cultural values; The use of existing databases on invasive alien species and their impacts, to support risk communication.

For example, environmental applications that aim to perform population-wide engineering, and technologies to directly engineer organisms in the environment, such as gene drives, RNAi technologies and horizontal environmental genetic alteration agents, are in development. We urgently need a process for broad and regular horizon scanning, monitoring and assessment of the most recent technological developments in synthetic biology, including of concrete applications of genome editing if they relate to synthetic biology. The Multidisciplinary Technical Expert Group on Synthetic Biology to support this process has to fully incorporate the expertise needed to cover the increasing diversity of applications that are expanding beyond agriculture, into human health, conservation, as well as gain-of-function experiments and reconstruction of pathogenic viruses. Such trends also emphasise the urgent need to conduct technology assessments to adequately assess the human, animal and plant health, socioeconomic, cultural and ethical impacts. There must be effective participation of indigenous peoples and local communities in the Multidisciplinary Technical Expert Group. In addition, the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples and local communities must be obtained before releasing any synthetic biology organisms, components or products that may impact their traditional knowledge, innovation, practices, livelihood and use of land, resources and water. We are extremely concerned by continued research and development on organisms containing engineered gene drives, with future plans for release. Such organisms, designed to spread indefinitely, have the potential to result in an irreversible impact on biodiversity. There is an urgent need to apply the precautionary principle to organisms containing engineered gene drives. We call for an immediate global moratorium on the release, including experimental release, into the environment of such organisms. At the same time, synthetic biology applications that are in early stages of research and development, including engineered gene drive systems, are being carried out in the laboratory. Accidental escape could result in the indefinite transmission of some of these technologies. There has to be stringent and robust contained use regulations at national levels. Urgently, we need international contained use regulations for organisms containing engineered gene drives, as these do not yet exist. Finally, further work on detection, identification and monitoring of organisms, components and products of synthetic biology, is urgent. In particular, there is a need to identify potential organisms of synthetic biology for which current tools are insufficient, and to develop additional detection, identification and monitoring tools.

The modification of wild organisms introduces the potential for next-generation effects as the organisms persist over time and space. Such increases in spatial and temporal complexities, along with fundamental knowledge gaps, as acknowledged by the AHTEG, increases uncertainty. We therefore agree with the AHTEG members who saw a clear need and rationale for guidance on risk assessment to be developed on living modified fish. The AHTEG also acknowledged that LMOs containing engineered gene drives pose specific challenges to risk assessment due to their invasive design to spread and persist in wild populations. This presents a potentially irreversible threat to biodiversity, which is compounded by the inability to control or recall a gene drive after release. Gene drives have potential next-generation effects. The inclusion of genetic engineering machinery that will continue to perform genetic engineering at every generation, in genetically diverse wild populations raises specific challenges due to the potential for unintended effects to occur over time, as acknowledged by the AHTEG. Evolutionary processes make it possible to turn events with a low probability of ever happening into events that are likely to happen. Inherent non-knowledge can, thereby, increase to such an extent that the conclusiveness of risk assessment is severely affected. We support the conclusion of the AHTEG that current risk assessment frameworks are insufficient for LMOs containing engineered gene drives. Given their invasive nature and inability to control, recall or reverse them, we call for an immediate global moratorium on the release, including experimental release, into the environment of such organisms. Any guidance on risk assessment has to fully operationalize the precautionary principle to protect against the potential irreversible damage to biodiversity and acknowledge the serious challenges to risk assessment for LMOs containing engineered gene drives. If it is likely that such organisms can escape spatio-temporal controllability, the risk assessment cannot be sufficiently reliable because it is not conclusive. Under such circumstances, the environmental release of such organisms is not compatible with the precautionary principle. The work of the AHTEG developing guidance on risk assessment for LMOs containing engineered gene drives must build on and complement existing CBD decisions on gene drives, inter alia, applying a precautionary approach, obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of potentially affected indigenous peoples and local communities, and assessing the socioeconomic, cultural and ethical impacts. Finally, given the rapid technology developments, including of LMOs produced through genome editing, it is urgent that additional guidance materials on risk assessment continue to be developed, taking into account priorities identified by Parties.

A robust monitoring framework is crucial for tracking and communicating our progress at global and national levels. We support headline indicators that can be applied nationally and globally. Regarding the proposals presented in CBD/SBSTTA/24/3 we are concerned about the feasibility of implementing such a large number of headline indicators at the national level. In our view, we should aim for a smaller number of headline indicators with high public resonance and the potential for national implementation and global aggregation, to show progress being made at both global and national levels. For example, a headline indicator on the quality and coverage of protected areas and OECMs would both resonate with the public and clearly track our progress towards 30 by 30 for the land and ocean. This could be done if targets were clustered under the relevant goals and then a small number 2 to 4 headline indicators were identified for each goal and cluster of targets. We support component and complementary indicators which can provide more depth of analysis and transparency at all levels, but there should be flexibility for Parties to use these at the national level, and to identify other indicators according to their national circumstances. We therefore suggest that SBSTTA should request the Secretariat: to revise the draft monitoring framework taking account of comments received at SBSTTA and SBI for further consideration at the OEWG. to assess the feasibility, capacity building and resource implications of implementing the monitoring framework, at national levels, and provide a report for consideration at COP15. Looking beyond COP15, further guidance is required to operationalise the monitoring framework and to help improve coherence between national and global indicators. We agree with the establishment of a technical expert group, and we should invite further support from the UN Statistical Commission, the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership, and other relevant organisations. We note the publication of CBD/SBSTTA/24/03/Addendum 2 and will provide detailed views through the peer review process. This provides important evidence underpinning the goals and targets. We would therefore find it very helpful if further information could be provided on quantitative elements relating to different levels of ambition. We would also like to see better coverage of information for the ocean, particularly given the level of support for 30by30. We must maintain the momentum towards COP15. We look forward to working with other Parties to help prepare for formal SBSTTA-24, SBI-3 and OEWG-3.

The CEE region would like to thank the Secretariat and others who contributed to the preparation of the documents for this agenda item. Before we present our views, let us express our deep gratitude to all involved in leading the post-2020 GBF development process, in the situation caused by the pandemic. As part of this process, CEE also highly appreciates the efforts to establish a strong and transparent monitoring of progress in achieving the new biodiversity plan. Regarding the structure of the framework, it can be seen that almost half of the proposed goal headline indicators and big part of target headline indicators are currently under development. This shows that further discussion on framework's elements and focus on available indicators are needed. In our view, there should be a limited yet comprehensive set of indicators. Also, available indicators can be better utilized. For example, SDG indicator 15.3.1 was rated as one of the highest scoring indicators relevant to T1, but it is proposed to serve only as a component indicator for T9. We believe that this SDG indicator should be used to monitor the progress in the range of restoration activities, while contributing to the better visibility of GBF in 2030. Furthermore, a progress towards goal B should be monitored through headline indicators for all three NCP groups. In this regard, we suggest that the proposed target indicator 7.0.1 be used as goal B headline indicator. The CEE region would like to highlight the importance of using those indicators that can help monitor the success of regional strategies. For example, the Green Agenda for the South-East Europe, overseen by Biodiversity Task Force in coordination with the Regional Cooperation Council and the European Commission, is expected to result in a sub-regional Biodiversity Strategy aligned with the post-2020 GBF. The regional strategy should provide a long-term plan for protecting nature and reversing the degradation, through potentials of regional cooperation on biodiversity, clean energy, and green economy. Regarding the criteria for selection, we believe that the monitoring framework should be equally applicable to all. We support the selection of indicators that can be disaggregated for national use. Also, the CEE region strongly supports the criteria of easy understanding, presentation, and interpretation of information, allowing for clear communication. Regarding the use of indicators, we would like to highlight the work of the NEA initiative in our region. This initiative, hosted by UNEP WCMC, in partnership with UNDP and UNESCO, with financial support from the IKI Initiative of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, and Nuclear Safety already supports two countries in the region, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Azerbaijan. We emphasize the role of national assessments in generation of new knowledge through education and better targeted research in ensuring better informed decisions. We suggest the introduction of relevant indicator for target 19, which would more directly monitor the use of the expanded biodiversity knowledge base on the decision-making process. The CEE considers that the technical expert group can play a crucial role in CB activities for monitoring framework. However, one of the first tasks of the group should be a rapid assessment of national capacities to report using agreed indicators. This group also should have an opportunity and obligation to communicate directly with CBD parties, providing advice on CB for indicators. Regarding the application of the modus operandi, it is not clear for which period the experts and co-chairs of this technical group will be elected. Finally, regarding the suggested recommendations, we would like to point out that after COP 15, there is a short period of 8 years until 2030 which also encompasses a time to gain support for national activities. In these circumstances, we believe that an introduction of monitoring framework, without its well-established role in national planning processes, may shift the focus of national priorities in the direction of developing the reporting capacities only. In this regard, the CEE region emphasizes the importance of wise and smooth transition towards the full implementation of the monitoring framework.

I'm speaking on behalf of the Global Partnership for Plant Conservation, a partnership of many of the world's leading botanical and plant conservation organisations and institutions. The Partnership was created in 2004 to support the implementation of the Convention's Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, the GSPC. Over the years, the GSPC has also involved thousands of plant conservationists in the CBD process, engaging their efforts often at community levels and aligning their actions with priorities at national levels. We welcome the Plant Conservation Report 2020, and the summary that was included in the Global Biodiversity Outlook 5. These highlighted considerable progress made in plant conservation efforts worldwide, including a World Flora Online and extensive new Red Listing of threatened plant species, especially trees, and related conservation efforts. We want to draw particular attention to the important role that the GSPC has played in mobilizing action amongst a wide range of stakeholders in relation to plant conservation, and also towards the achievement of several Aichi Targets and the objectives of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity over the last decade. We are grateful to the Executive Secretary for providing an Information Document on the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation for this meeting, including a draft proposal for a new phase of the GSPC for the period post-2020. We wish to record therefore our support for the development of a post-2020 Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC). We urge that an updated GSPC be developed and fully aligned with the post 2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, specifying specific sub-targets or components where appropriate. We hope that proposals for this can be put in place by the Executive Secretary, in consultation with the SBSTTA co-chairs, and subsequently brought for consideration by COP 15. Thank you.

Thank you chair, We wish to thank the secretariat for the preparation of this agenda item. The Netherlands support a strong framework as a prerequisite for a robust monitoring, reporting, stocktake and review mechanism for the Global Biodiversity Framework. We do not want to risk another decade of ambitious targets that remain out of reach. We are of the opinion that all goal and target components need proper indicators, so that progress can be measured and compared, in an independent and objective manner. We aim at a shorter and realistic list of Headline Indicators that covers the most important aspects of the post-2020 goals and targets, covering the full scope of the framework. However, at the same time we are concerned that Genetic diversity indicators have not been sufficiently addressed so far. Each element of Goal A, including genetic diversity, should be explicitly mentioned in one or more corresponding Targets to ensure reporting. With respect to the benefit sharing goal and target, the proposed monitoring framework lacks indicators to measure the enhancement of ABS regimes and thereby ABS processes as such. We would like to stress that an increase in benefit-sharing is enabled through effective ABS measures which facilitate access, are easy to comply with and provide for legal certainty. Furthermore non-monetary benefits shared should be valued and represented in the monitoring framework. The Netherlands is committed to the vision of Living in Harmony with Nature by 2050. As we have lost more biodiversity over the period 2011-2020, the ambition level for some goals and targets will have to be increased beyond the Aichi Targets. The appropriate level of ambition needs to be ensured through the precise wording of the goal/target as well as setting the necessary level of science-based numerical/quantitative elements. Additionally, a higher level of political commitment and means of implementation needs to be secured. As this is the first time we take the floor, We wish to conclude our speaking points with a short message from the youth representatives in our delegation. It will be spoke out by me, to avoid technical difficulties by switching microphones. Here it comes: The youth may not be old enough to vote, or old enough to make decisions, but we are old enough to be witnessing and experiencing the future effects of the biodiversity crisis. You are now deciding on that future, let us contribute to your conversations. Eva and Evi are the Dutch youth representatives on Biodiversity. We are grateful to have a seat here at the SBSTTA. However, it strikes us that we are, as far as we know, the only youth delegates who are members of a party-delegation to the CBD Younger generations are crucial as we can hold up a mirror to policymakers by bringing fresh ideas and asking critical questions. We would therefore like to call on all parties to follow this lead and include youth representatives in their delegation.. Enable the youth to inspire, incite and surprise you, a conference full of adults.

We appreciate the efforts of the Chair, the Secretariat and all the people concerned to organize this meeting in the face of this difficult situation due to Covid-19. Taking advantage of today's opportunity, we need to accelerate the developing process for the post-2020 GBF, making the utmost use of the various modern technologies. We would like to briefly explain Japan's overview on \"the Post-2020 global biodiversity framework\", since we have limited time today. We will send our detailed views to the Secretariat later and we would like it to be made available online. In the post-2020 GBF, Japan recognizes the need for a mechanism where the implementation as well as the contents of its targets and goals are appropriately monitored and reviewed, and when the implementation is not enough, further efforts are encouraged. From this viewpoint, we basically welcome the document CBD/SBSTTA/24/3 prepared by the Secretariat, however, we recognize there are still some issues to be discussed. First, Japan is of the view that biodiversity issues can be divided in two categories; one is those that should be addressed by adding up global efforts by Parties, and the other is local issues that should be addressed depending on regional characteristics. Therefore, we think that indicators and its monitoring method should be different depending on the characteristics of goals and targets that are to be set. From this viewpoint, we think that using headline indicators will contribute to monitoring national efforts and progresses objectively through national reports, and also to making it easier to compare the progresses between Parties. However, we think that headline indicators should be set to attract political attention to biodiversity issues, and to monitor the progress of the post-2020 GBF at a global level through representative elements. Therefore, we are of the view that headline indicators should be applied only to those targets that require global efforts and ratcheting up to raise ambition when the progress is not sufficient to achieve these targets and goals. Second, we think that the component indicators should play a role to monitor the progress of goals and targets that don't have headline indicators according to the definition mentioned above. In other words, component indicators should be set in order to prevent from missing any progress of the post2020 GBF. The number of indicators should be minimized for tracking the progress of each target and goal. Also, taking into account the lessons learned from GBO-5, we propose they will be applied to the NBSAPs and thus be used in national report of each Party. Lastly, with regard to the proposed technical expert group on indicators, we think there is a possibility to making use of existing frameworks such as IPBES or BIP. In addition, we need to carefully consider the number of necessary in-person meetings during the intersessional period taking into account utilizing virtual meetings. We will submit our detailed comments on this agenda to the Secretariat later. Thank you for your attention.
