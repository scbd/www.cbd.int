                            <strong>The Bio-Bridge Initiative (BBI)</strong> was established by the Government of the Republic of Korea at the twelfth meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 12) in 2014 to enhance technical and scientific cooperation
                            (TSC) and technology transfer under the Convention, with a view to supporting the effective implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets (ABTs), as well as the updated national
                            biodiversity strategies and action plans (decision XII/2/B2). BBI is designed to complement existing programmes and mechanisms under CBD and its Protocols. In their Gangwon Declaration on Biodiversity for Sustainable Development,
                            the Ministers of Environment and other heads of delegation who met on 15 to 16 October 2014 in Pyeongchang, Republic of Korea, recognized the need for enhanced TSC among countries to implement the objectives of the Convention
                            and welcomed, among other initiatives, the Bio-Bridge Initiative on TSC for the accelerated implementation of the Pyeongchang Roadmap 2020. The initial phase of BBI has focused on establishing the necessary institutional structures,
                            developing tools and mechanisms to support TSC, developing a BBI Action Plan 2017-2020, and supporting a few pilot TSC projects.
                        </p>
                        <h3>BBI in a Nutshell</h3>

                        <p>BBI’s core goal is the promotion and facilitation of TSC. This will be achieved through various tools and mechanisms including help desk services, an interactive web platform, meetings and roundtables and a small seed funding facility.</p>
                        <lu class="bbilist">
                            <li> Help-desk: assisting Parties in articulating their needs and requests for assistance and facilitating the matching of needs to with available support through collaborative partnerships.</li>
                            <li> Interactive web platform for TSC: serving as one-stop facility for access to TSC opportunities and resources, including the online form for submission of requests for assistance, the roster of TSC providers, and databases of
                                replicable success stories ("bright spots"), good practices and appropriate technologies.</li>
                            <li> Meetings and roundtables: mobilizing international, regional and national organizations and networks to support BBI in facilitating TSC and to catalyze new TSC initiatives.</li>
                            <li> Seed funding facility: providing occasional seed funding to catalyze TSC initiatives on specific biodiversity-related topics.</li>
                        </lu> <br> An active network of partners will underpin all BBI activities.


                        <h3>  What is Technical and Scientific Cooperation?</h3>

                        <p> In the context of CBD technical and scientific cooperation (TSC) is defined as a process whereby two or more countries or institutions pursue their individual or collective biodiversity-related goals through cooperative actions
                            and/or exchange of scientific knowledge, expertise, data, resources, technologies and technical know-how.</p>
                        <p> As envisaged in Article 18 of the CBD, TSC encompasses human resources development, institutional building, joint research programmes, joint ventures for development of technologies, technology transfer, and other elements.>/p>

                            <h3>Why Technical and Scientific Cooperation (TSC)?</h3>

                            <p>TSC is one of the various means of enabling Parties to implement the Convention and its Protocols in addition to capacity-building, information sharing, training and other means.</p>
                            <p> TSC helps foster synergies, maximizes the utilization of existing resources, facilitates access to a wide range of knowledge, experiences and lessons learned, and often results in greater impact of the implementation efforts.</p>

                            Other benefits include:

                                <li>Magnifying biodiversity solutions that have been tested in other places;</li>
                                <li>Sustainable capacity-building initiatives; and</li>
                                <li>Mutually beneficial partnerships.</li>
                            </lu>

                        <p>The Platform is a vehicle for promoting and facilitating TSC. The platform is developed as part of CBD’s clearing-house mechanism (CHM), and will be integrated with other online capacity development tools and aligned with the Web
                            Strategy for the Convention and its Protocols, and any policies and procedures for managing the CBD website.</p>
                        <p>The CHM will remain the repository for any databases and case studies of relevance to the implementation of the Convention and its Protocols. The BBI web platform will link to these resources, providing a list of curated resources
                            that are specifically relevant to TSC.</p>
                        <p>
                            An up-to-date online archive of resources relevant to BBI operations and requests for assistance from Parties, as well as links to other TSC mechanisms, tools, funding sources, technical assistance experts, etc.), will be accessible through the web platform.
                            BBI will not duplicate resources that already exist on other websites and databases, but will instead provide short descriptions about them (metadata) and links to the respective websites. At a later stage, BBI will explore
                            the potential for making the web platform interactive to promote a user-driven exchange and sharing of resources, with reduced oversight by BBI
