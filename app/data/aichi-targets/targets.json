Actions promote the consumption of new species and diversity of crops and varieties to reduce pressures on species under threat, establishment of small- and medium-size enterprises, sustainable use of alternative energy and sustainable management of production landscapes.  Community-based biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management approaches are also promoted (efforts to ensure community involvement in natural resource management have been highly sector-focused). In addition, integrated action frameworks on all activities (mining, industrial logging, smallholder agriculture, and illegal logging) impacting on forest biodiversity conservation are to be developed and/or intensified.

The industry is undergoing a process of diversification and work in relation to seaweed culture, shell fish culture and sea cucumber culture is in the first developmental stage. It is recognized that sustainable aquaculture development requires responsible planning. An aquaculture approach which holds promise in reducing environmental impact is the recent trend in Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA), combining fed fish and extractive aquaculture (seaweed and shellfish). Moreover, the provision of secondary crops through IMTA contributes to ensuring the sustainability of farms.

Under the EPC Act, it is possible for Community Conservation Areas (CCAs) to be registered by communities. CCAs are intended to complement traditional management and provide communities with the option to enforce legal protection over their resources.

This project is addressing Borneo’s biodiverse peat-swamp forests that are being destroyed by annual fires which cause huge public health problems and destroy large swathes of rainforest, while releasing carbon and contributing to climate change.

Work is currently underway to establish a regulatory framework for genetic resources.  The country also intends to develop an inventory on traditional knowledge. Research on genetic diversity is being strengthened through the National Fund for Innovation and Scientific and Technological Development of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology, and encompasses projects on bioprospecting. A practical guide for the application of the regulation on access to genetic resources, associated Traditional Knowledge and fair and equitable distribution of benefits was prepared in 2018.  Capacity-building activities aimed at local communities are being implemented. The country is also promoting the ratification of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) to which it is currently a signatory. (6NR)"
